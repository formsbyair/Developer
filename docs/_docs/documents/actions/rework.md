**Rework** can be used to return a non-purged document to workflow after delivery where it was approved in error or new information has become available.

If the form requires authorisation, Workflow Status will be set to **Authorised**, and the Authorised Assignment Expression (if any) will be evaluated for assignment.

If the form does not require authorisation, Workflow Status will be set to **Pending** and assignment will remain with the last assigned user.

**Rework** is available in the Options menu when viewing a document's information for Administrators.

The document will be re-delivered on Approval.

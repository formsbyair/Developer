**What is Two Factor Authentication?**  
In addition to the 'Email Address and Password'combination to log in the FormsByAir portal an extra layer of security can be added. FormsByAir uses the Google Authenticator app to add Two Factor authentication (2FA) to your login process. This generates an additional one-time password which must be entered in addition to the 'Email Address and Password' combination.

title: Existing document version check
type: platform

FormsByAir will now check the version of existing documents when saving or submitting. If a user attempts to submit an older version of a document they will receive a warning message instructing them to reload to get the latest version. If the document has already been submitted they'll receive an error message.

This may occur where:

* A request is updated in our portal (e.g. to correct a mistake) while the user has the form open in their browser
* An existing document is opened in multiple windows or on multiple devices and the user attempts to save or submit more than one of them

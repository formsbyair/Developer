title: Hide first third party request
type: feature
---

Added new option **Hide First** for third party requests.

When enabled on a Request element within a repeater, FormsByAir will hide the prompt to create a request for the *first* repeater item.

This may help to avoid confusion with forms that require completion by multiple people, where the first person is generally the main form filler (so a request is not required for them)

See [Requests]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/elements/requests)

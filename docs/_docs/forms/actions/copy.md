## Options

#### New Form Title
Title for the new form. If the title already exists we'll add a unique number to the end when you click Copy.

#### Account
This option will appear if you have access to multiple accounts, allowing you to select which account you want to copy the form to.

#### Copy Form Integrations
If this option is checked we'll copy all active and disabled form integrations to the new form, and update integration references within the form.

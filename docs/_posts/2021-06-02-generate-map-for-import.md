title: Generate map for import

FormsByAir can now generate JSON data maps for import integrations based on the current version of your form.

Click **Generate Map** while editing an Import integration to generate and download a map that you can use as the basis of a custom map.

Alternatively, FormsByAir will generate a map automatically when you import a JSON file for an integration that doesn't have a map, effectively providing a straight match on JSON property names to Tag names.

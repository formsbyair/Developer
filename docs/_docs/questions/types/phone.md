#### Validation Errors

Validation of phone numbers is done for for international and international mobile numbers only and therefore need a valid country code.

To configure this, go to Advanced Settings and set the format to 'International' or 'International Mobile' and enter a valid Country Code. 
eg. 'NZ' for New Zealand or 'AU' for Australia

If validation fails an error message will appear. eg. for an invalid New Zealand phone number
:exclamation: Not a valid NZ phone number | Ignore

or for an invalid internation Austrlain mobile number
:exclamation: Not a valid AU mobile number | Ignore

There is an option to ignore invalid numbers.

If the phone number is valid the number will be formatted according to standard internationl rules.
eg. for international Mobile / Counry Code set to NZ an entry of '0223709899' will be formatted as '+64 22 370 9899'

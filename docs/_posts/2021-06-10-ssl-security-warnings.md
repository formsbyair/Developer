We've resolved an issue for MacOS and iOS users who may have received a "Connection Is Not Private" warning in their browser when accessing formsbyair.com

This was caused by a conflict with our SSL certificate and a change in MacOS 11.4 and iOS 14.6, see https://nz.godaddy.com/help/the-connection-is-not-private-warning-when-you-open-your-site-on-a-device-with-macos-114-or-ios-146-40579

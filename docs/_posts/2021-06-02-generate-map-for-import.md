title: Generate map for import
type: platform

FormsByAir can now generate JSON data maps for import integrations based on the current version of your form.

This means you can add a JSON import integration without attaching a map, and we'll generate one when you import a file, effectively providing an automatic match on Tag names and JSON Property names.

In addition, you can click **Generate Map** while editing an Import integration to create a file you can use as a template for a custom map.

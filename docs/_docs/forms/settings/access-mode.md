Controls how a form can be accessed.

#### Normal

The form can be opened and filled out by anyone that has access to it.

#### Request Only

Only requests or saved documents can be opened, the blank form cannot be opened - FormsByAir will return a generic 404 error so as to not disclose the validity or status of the form.

#### Third-Party Prefill

The form will default to **Prefill** mode when opened. This is useful for forms that are managed by non-authenticated third parties on behalf of others. For example, insurance declaration forms prefilled by advisers, and then completed by their clients.

#### Kiosk

The form will open in Kiosk mode, meaning **Save & Finish Later** and web browser autofill are disabled, and the form will automatically reset on submission.

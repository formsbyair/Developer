**Revalidate** can be used to reprocess external validation e.g. identity verification, where a correction is made to a document in workflow, rather than **Returning** it.

**Revalidate** is available in the Options menu when viewing a document with a workflow status of **EDITED** for Administrators and Supervisors.

Selecting **Revalidate** will queue the document for validation and redirect to the workflow queue. The document may take a few seconds or longer to reappear in the workflow queue depending on the availability of the relevant validation services.

If a document does not contain any validation elements it will not be queued for validation.

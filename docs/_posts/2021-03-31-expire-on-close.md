title: Expire on close
type: platform
---

**Requested** and **Saved** documents normally expire on a rolling basis as follows:

* 30 days (or as configured for form) after request was generated; or
* 30 days after last save

We've applied an update so that requested/saved documents for a form with fixed **Close Date/Time** will override this behaviour and remain active up until the close date/time.
